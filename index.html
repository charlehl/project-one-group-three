                  Does a travel advisory make travel destinations less attractive? Does weather make a difference?
                  In this project we tried tried to answer these questions.  What we found ulitmately was that travel
                  advisories are not a factor when people plan their travel destinations.  We found that the majority
                  of the passenger travel trends correlated with the temperature.  In addition, we found that there were outliers
                  where passenger travel did not follow this trend.  Upon further analysis, we found that even during higher
                  temperatures, that rain was also a factor which accounted for these anomalies.  This website is a highlight 
                  for our project work.

                  We began by gathering data for all of the US-carrier flights in and out of the United States.  We isolated
                  the flights which originated from the the US and whose destination was outside of the US.  We gathered all flight 
                  data from 2013 to 2017.  We broke down the passenger travel by city for each year then ranked the cities based upon 
                  the total yearly travel.  Using the rank from each year we averaged all of these to get a final ranking for our data.  
                  From there we were able to establish our top 10 cities.  For the scope of our project, we only looked at the top 10 
                  as we did not have time to look into more.  Given more time and resources, we would have liked to look at more cities.
                </p>

                  We were able to gather a travel advisory json file which listed travel advisories given by the US government.  Unfortunately 
                  the data only gave the travel advisory and last updated date.  It would have been nice to have seen travel advisories given by 
                  date but we were unable to obtain such data.  From the travel advisory last update date, we were able to search for our city
                  and then to run a t-test to see if there was any difference in travel patterns from the year before the travel advisory and the 
                  year following.  After not finding any significant change, we next mapped out the passenger travel by month versus the average 
                  temperature by month.  From the plot we were able to see a linear relationship between passenger travel peaks and temperature. 
                  There were few anomalies which we were able to account for by rain.  Lastly, there was anomaly which we were unable to account for 
                  in our analysis.  Unfortunately we were unable to account for Mexico City with any factor.  For our post mortem, we would have liked 
                  to have been able to account for this travel pattern.
